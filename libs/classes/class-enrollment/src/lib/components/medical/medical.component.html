                    My child is in good physical and mental health. I have
                    listed any special health considerations. I acknowledge that
                    acceptance of my child to the program with my child's
                    special health considerations is at the discretion of
                    Mountain SOL School. In case of emergency, I understand that
                    every effort will be made to contact parents or guardians of
                    children. In the event I cannot be reached within a
                    reasonable time, I grant permission to the physician
                    selected by Mountain SOL staff to hospitalize, secure
                    treatment for and to order injection, anesthesia or surgery
                    for the child as named herein.

                    I authorize my child to participate in the program and any
                    associated transportation services provided by Mountain SOL
                    School or its agents. I acknowledge that I am the only one
                    who can determine if I or my child is physically fit enough
                    or adequately skilled enough to participate in the program.
                    I acknowledge the inherent risks that may result from by
                    child’s participation in the program including falls,
                    fractures, contraction of infectious diseases, misbehavior
                    of other children, etc., all of which may result in injury
                    or death to my child or damage to his/her/our property. I
                    further acknowledge that Mountain SOL School is neither a
                    common carrier nor in the business of providing
                    transportation services to the public. I expressly assume
                    these risks and any associated costs, damages or losses,
                    including those caused by simple negligence of Mountain SOL
                    School, and waive and fully release all claims held by me,
                    my spouse/partner, my child or any of our estates from and
                    against Mountain SOL School and its agency partners,
                    officers, board members, agents, employees, volunteers and
                    representatives, arising from my child’s attendance and
                    participation in the program and accept full responsibility
                    for the cost of all medical treatment to my child as a
                    result of any injuries caused by or through such other
                    risks. This waiver and release will apply to any and all
                    actions, causes, damages, claims or demands of any kind,
                    whether known or unknown, arising out of or otherwise
                    incidental to participation in the program. I further agree,
                    on behalf of myself and/or my child, to indemnify, defend
                    and hold harmless Mountain SOL School and its agency
                    partners, officers, board members, agents, employees,
                    volunteers and representatives from any injuries,
                    liabilities, claims, damages and expenses, including
                    attorney fees, incurred by Mountain SOL School, me, my child
                    or on behalf of my child, arising from my child’s attendance
                    and participation in the program, with the exception of
                    gross negligence or reckless misconduct of Mountain SOL
                    School. While participating in the program, I and my child
                    will obey all rules, regulations and laws of the State of
                    West Virginia and the United States. I and my child will
                    further obey all rules, regulations and policies of Mountain
                    SOL School associated with the program. I acknowledge that
                    my or my child’s failure to comply with these rules,
                    regulations, policies and laws may result in my or my
                    child’s expulsion from the program. I agree that this
                    release will be governed by the laws of the State of West
                    Virginia. If any provision of this release is found to be
                    invalid or unenforceable, then the remainder of this release
                    will have full force and effect, and the invalid provision
                    will be modified, or partially enforced, to the maximum
                    extent permitted by West Virginia State law.
