            <b>Description:</b> <br />
            From 12-4pm we will have a project work day, led by Mountain SOL
            staff and students but open to the public, in support of Chestnut
            Ridge Park. We will be doing projects including gardening and
            maintenance. <br /><br />
            From 5-9pm more people will gather, and we will have our big summer
            solstice party! There will be potluck food, music, fire, and
            activities. This is a favorite event for building our Mountain SOL
            community, as many new students and older Mountain SOL alums all
            gather together to party outdoors! <br />
