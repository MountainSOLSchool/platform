            <b>Description:</b> <br />
            Our Summer Solstice event will have two parts: a work day to support
            Chestnut Ridge Park and our annual summer solstice potluck party.
            You, your family, and any guests you would like to bring are welcome
            to come to either or both parts of our summer solstice event!
            <br /><br />
            From 12-4pm we will have a project work day, led by Mountain SOL
            staff and students but open to the public, in support of Chestnut
            Ridge Park. We will be doing projects including gardening and
            maintenance. <br /><br />
            From 5-9pm more people will gather, and we will have our big summer
            solstice party! There will be potluck food, music, fire, and
            activities. This is a favorite event for building our Mountain SOL
            community, as many new students and older Mountain SOL alums all
            gather together to celebrate outdoors! <br />
