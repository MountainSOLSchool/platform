                    surgery for the child as named herein.

                <p>
                    I acknowledge that I am the only one who can determine if I

                    I acknowledge the inherent risks that may result from by
                    child's participation in the program including falls,
                    fractures, contraction of infectious diseases, misbehavior
                    of other children, etc., all of which may result in injury
                    or death to my child or damage to his/her/our property. I
                    further acknowledge that Mountain SOL School is neither a
                    common carrier nor in the business of providing
                    transportation services to the public. I expressly assume
                    these risks and any associated costs, damages or losses,
                    including those caused by simple negligence of Mountain SOL
                    School, and waive and fully release all claims held by me,

                    participation in the program and accept full responsibility
                    for the cost of all medical treatment to my child as a
                    result of any injuries caused by or through such other
                    risks. This waiver and release will apply to any and all

                    I further agree, on behalf of myself and/or my child, to

                    and participation in the program, with the exception of
                    gross negligence or reckless misconduct of Mountain SOL
                    School. While participating in the program, I and my child
                    will obey all rules, regulations and laws of the State of
                    West Virginia and the United States. I and my child will

                    I acknowledge that my or my child's failure to comply with
                    these rules, regulations, policies and laws may result in my
                    or my child's expulsion from the program. I agree that this
                    release will be governed by the laws of the State of West
                    Virginia. If any provision of this release is found to be

                    extent permitted by West Virginia State law.
